# brandPrediction
Goal

 Predicting the customers' brand preferences that are missing from the incomplete surveys by conducting two classification methods in R. 

Datasets used

  Complete Responses: This csv file contains the 10,000 completed survey responses
  
  Survey Key: This file also includes a tab that explains the survey questions and the numeric code for each of the possible answers
in the survey.

  Survey_Incomplete: This is the data set used to test your model. It includes 5,000 observations, but no brand preference 
this is what I predicted.
